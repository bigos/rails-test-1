rails-test-1
============

This is a failed test. To try it out, clone the repository, run bundle install and the migrations. After the migrations run: rake example_data:import

http://localhost:3000/reminder/date

I didn't do much Rails coding over last few months. It took me around one hour to write the reminder function, but now I am stuck.
